# ML-Based Assisted Access Control Action/Permission Prediction

## Description
This project aims to build a machine learning model for managing employees’ access to organizational resources. By accurately predicting authorized or unauthorized access based on historical patterns, this model seeks to replace static security policies with a dynamic, data-driven approach.

## Task
1. Build a machine learning model to predict access permissions for employees.  
2. Use the Kaggle Amazon Employee Access Challenge dataset to train and test the model.  
3. Replace traditional security policies with predictions generated by the trained model.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle Amazon Employee Access Challenge (collected from 2010–2011) and contains:
- **Training set**: 32,769 samples  
- **Testing set**: 58,922 samples
